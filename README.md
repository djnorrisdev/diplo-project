# Diplo Tribute Project

This project was created to highlight html and css skills without the use of frameworks. The site was created using css flexbox and css grid, along with css animations for transition effects. Javascript was used for the mobile drop-down menu. The landing page is fully responsive and displays well across all modern devices.
